Hello there! Thanks for visiting my blog.

It's Mykola, a guy behind the n0rdy blog, a software engineer passionate about tech, books, and mountains.
Here is my favorite quote from J.R.R. Tolkien's *The Hobbit* that resonates with me:

> ...then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking stick...

This blog is about different aspects of software engineering and technology in general, as I don't believe in "the best programming language / paradigm / framework" concepts. I do have some preferences, though ;)
I hope you'll find something useful for yourself, learn something new, or just have a good time reading my posts.

My contacts are in the footer if you have any questions or just want to say "Hi".

If you like my blog and don't want to miss new posts, subscribe to my newsletter below.
The new issue is sent once I publish a new post - it's not as often as I'd like to, so you won't get spammed.

You can find the previous issues of my newsletter [here](https://mail.n0rdy.foo/archive).

Have fun! =)
