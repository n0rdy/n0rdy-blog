Hello there! Thanks for visiting my blog.

My name is Mykola.
I'm a software engineer passionate about tech, books, and mountains.
Here is my favorite quote from J.R.R. Tolkien's *The Hobbit* that I feel a personal connection to:

> ...then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking stick...

I don't believe there is such thing as "the best programming language/paradigm/framework", that's why this blog is about different aspects of software engineering and technology in general.
I hope you'll find something useful for yourself, learn something new, or just have a good time reading my posts.

If you have any questions or suggestions or would like to say "Hi!", you can find my contacts in the footer.
