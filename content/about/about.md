Hello there! 

I haven't come up with a good way to introduce myself yet, so I'll just leave you with this quote from J.R.R. Tolkien's *The Hobbit* that I feel personal connection to:

> ...then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick...
