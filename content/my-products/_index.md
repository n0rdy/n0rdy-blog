## Featured Products

### Talk To Locals
A two-way voice translator that turns your phone into a speaking interpreter.

Talk To Locals is the only voice-to-voice translator that lets you have natural conversations: no typing, no screen-passing, no awkward pauses. Just place your phone between you and anyone speaking 40+ languages, and it translates both voices in real-time.

Perfect for ordering in local restaurants, meeting your partner's family, settling in as an expat/nomad, or discovering stories only locals know. First 10 minutes free, then pay only for what you use, no subscriptions.
