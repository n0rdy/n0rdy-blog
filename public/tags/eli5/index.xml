      <description>Hello there! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote here - all of a sudden, 2024 became way busier than I planned it to be. But hey, it&amp;rsquo;s good to be back!

Eowyn: Hey, buddy! I&amp;rsquo;m building a web project that has the frontend and backend parts. Whenever I click a button on the UI (that triggers a DELETE request to the server), my browser blows with these errors: I tried calling the same endpoint with the curl command, and it works.</description>
