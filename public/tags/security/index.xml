      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there! If you follow tech news, you might have heard about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://trust.okta.com/security-advisories/okta-ad-ldap-delegated-authentication-username/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Okta security incident&lt;/a&gt; that was reported on 1st of November. The TLDR of the incident was this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Bcrypt algorithm was used to generate the cache key where we hash a  combined string of userId + username + password.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there! Another evening, on my way back home, I decided to check the mailbox. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean my email inbox, but the old-school actual box where the postman puts the physical letters. And to my great surprise, I found an envelope there with something inside! While opening it, I spent a few moments hoping that it&amp;rsquo;s the decades delayed letter from Hogwarts. But then I had to get back down to Earth, once I noticed that it&amp;rsquo;s a boring &amp;ldquo;grown-up&amp;rdquo; letter from the bank. I skimmed through the text and realized that my &amp;ldquo;digital-only&amp;rdquo; bank for cool kids had been acquired by the biggest player on the local market. And as a token of the new beginning, they added this to the envelope:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
