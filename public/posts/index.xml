      <description>Go concurrency simplified. Part 4: Post office as a data pipeline Hello there! The main part of my moving to a new place adventures seems to be behind. Since I&amp;rsquo;m still waiting for a furniture delivery, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post while lying on the floor using my foam camping mat as a sofa. It&amp;rsquo;s not the most ideal setup, but it works. Anyway, I feel like today is the right time to start working on Part 4 of the &amp;ldquo;Go concurrency simplified&amp;rdquo; series.</description>

      <description>Go concurrency simplified. Part 3: Managing channels with for loops and select statements Hello there! I feel like I got my covid under control and will be back to daily life soon. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;m sitting at my desk in a nearly empty apartment (I&amp;rsquo;m moving soon) and wondering whether it&amp;rsquo;s possible to produce an echo if I scream loud enough ðŸ¤” Anyway, I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s the right time to start working on Part 3 of the &amp;ldquo;Go concurrency simplified&amp;rdquo; series.</description>

      <description>Go concurrency simplified. Part 2: Syncing goroutines with sync.WaitGroup Hello there! Despite the beautiful snowy weather outside, I&amp;rsquo;m at home these days with covid, so I can dedicate some additional time to blogging.
Last time, we discussed the very basic concepts of Go concurrency: goroutines and channels. If you missed that post, please check it out here, it has some cool drawings =) Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll move on and explore the ways Go offers us to sync goroutines - it will help us get rid of some hacky workarounds we have used so far.</description>

      <description>Go concurrency simplified. Part 1: Channels and goroutines Christmas season is around the corner, that&amp;rsquo;s why another evening I was standing in a long queue at the post office with some Xmas presents packed inside the box. The line moved pretty slowly, as there was only one postman for the whole crowd of customers. The guy was running back and forth, and I felt really sorry for him. Not sure why, either out of boredom or because of several long evenings I spent working on my open-source library for managing asynchronous pipelines, but my brain turned engineering mode on and tried to optimize the process of handling parcels.</description>

      <description>AI tools for developers - things to be careful about Hello there! If you followed tech news this year, I believe you&amp;rsquo;ll agree that AI was the hottest topic in 2023. And the chances are that in 2024, this area will grow even bigger alongside the new astonishing scientific discoveries in this field.
I can guess with a high probability that you have already embedded some of the AI tools in your daily life or career-related activities - if you haven&amp;rsquo;t, you are missing out a lot, my friend!</description>
